#notes for design patterns

*Design patterns
-Is a general repeatable solutions to some commonly occuring problems during software design process.
-It's not a finished design that can be employed to development process
-It's rather a template or description that can continously be used to solve problems associated with      designs and it can be used in many different situations.


*USES OF DESIGN PATTERNS
-It can speed up the development process by employing the tested,proven development paradigms
-It can help in effective development by considering issues that may not arrise earlier until later on in implementations.
-It improves readability to the coders and archtects that are familiar with the patterns
-It provides general solutions to the problems associated with designs rather than having one issue at a time
-patterns allows developers to communicate using well-known and well understood names for software interaction 
-They can be improved over time making them more robust than ad-hoc designs


*CREATIONAL DESIGN PATTERNS
-These design patterns uses class instantations.
-They are of two types
*class-creation patterns
-it uses class inheritance effectively in instantation process
*object-creational patterns
-it uses delegation effectively to get job done

>Abstract Factory
-it creates an instance of several families of classes

>builder
-it separates object construction from it's presentation 

>Factory method
-creates an instance of several derived classes

>Object Pool
-Avoid expensive acquistions and release of resources by recycling objects that are not in use.

>Prototype
-A fully initialized instance to be copied or cloned

>singleton
-Is a class of which only a single instance can exist

*STRUCTURAL DESING PATTERNS
-This pattern is all about class and object composition.Structural class-creation uses class inheritance to compose interfaces while structural object-creation patterns defines new ways to compose objects to obtain new functionalities.

>adapter
-Matches instances of different classes

>Bridge
-It separates object interfaces from its implementation

>Composite
-Is a tree structure of simple composite objects

>Decorator
-Adds responsibilities to the object dynamically

>Facade
-A single class that represents a whole subsystems 

>Flyweight
-A fine grained instance used for efficient sharing

>Private class/Data
-prevents/Restricts accessor/mutator

>Proxy
-An object represents another object


*BEHAVIORAL DESIGN PATTERNS
-These designs patterns are all about class's objects communication 
-it deals with how objects communicates of a class

>chain of responsibilities
-Is a way of passing a request between a chain of objects

>command
-encapsulates a command request as an object

>Interpreter
-Is a way to include langauge element into a program

>Iterator
-sequentially access the elements of a list/collection

>Mediator
-defines simplified communication between a classes

>Memento
-captures and restore an object's internal state

>Null object
-Is design to act as a default value of an object

>Observer
-Is a way of notfying a change to a number of classes

>state
-it alters object's behavior when its state changes

>strategy
-encapsulates an algorithm inside a class

>Template method
-defer the exact algorithms of a class to a subclass

>Visitor
-defines a new operation of in a class without any changes
